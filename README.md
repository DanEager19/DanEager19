### Hi there!

I'm currently attending DSU, majoring in Cyber Operations as well as Cyber Leadership. I'll be graduating in 2024. <br>

In my spare time, I'm working on my Full-Stack web app, In-DB. It's using the MERN stack along with some other tools like SASS and GraphQL <br>

I'm big into homelabbing. I've set up a little home network of Raspberry Pis and a refurbished HP Compaq. AMA about them! <br>

I upload some of my class code as private repos. I also have some other side-projects, scripts, dotfiles, etc. <br>

My areas of study, whether in classes or on my own, generally revolve around cybersecurity, web applications, and computer networking. 

I generally work with HTML/CSS, TypeScript, C++, and Bash. However, I'm comfortable with SQL, MongoDB, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and C. I'd like to start learning some Rust, Go, and Dart.
