### Hi there!

I'm currently attending DSU, majoring in Cyber Operations as well as Cyber Leadership. I'll be graduating in 2024. <br>

In my spare time, I'm working on my Full-Stack web app, In-DB. It's using the MERN stack along with some other tools like SASS and GraphQL <br>

I'm big into homelabbing. I've set up a little home network of Raspberry Pis. AMA about them! <br>

I upload some of my class code as private repos. I also have some other side-projects, scripts, dotfiles, etc. <br>

My areas of study, whether in classes or on my own, generally revolve around cybersecurity, web applications, and computer networking. I have expereince with LAMP and MERN. I'd like to start branching out into thing such as MEAN, Petite-Firebase, Django, Web Assembly, or Ruby on Rails. 

Languages:
- C/C++
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- PHP

Pseudo-Languages
- HTML/CSS
- SASS
- SQL/MySQL
- MongoDB
