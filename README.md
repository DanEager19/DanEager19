### Hi there!

I'm currently attending DSU, majoring in Cyber Operations as well as Cyber Leadership. I'll be graduating in 2024. <br>

In my spare time, I'm working on my Full-Stack web app, In-DB. It's using the MERN stack along with some other tools like SASS and GraphQL <br>

I'm big into homelabbing. I've set up a little home network of Raspberry Pis. AMA about them! <br>

I upload some of my class code as private repos. I also have some other side-projects, scripts, dotfiles, etc. <br>

I'm begin into learning about web development! I have expereince with LAMP, Node, React, Mongo, and more!
